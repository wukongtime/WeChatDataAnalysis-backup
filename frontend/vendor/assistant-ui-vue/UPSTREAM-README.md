# `@assistant-ui/vue`

> Not published yet. This package is the in-repo preview of the Vue bridge and stays private until the Vue integration is complete.

Vue bindings for assistant-ui. Bridges the framework-neutral `@assistant-ui/store` client into Vue via `<AuiProvider>`, `useAui`, `useAuiState`, and `useAuiEvent`.

The runtime layer runs on `@assistant-ui/tap`, a headless hooks runtime that needs no React renderer. Alias `react` to `@assistant-ui/tap/standalone-shim` in your bundler so the shared runtime code resolves without React installed:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "react/compiler-runtime": "@assistant-ui/tap/standalone-shim/compiler-runtime",
      react: "@assistant-ui/tap/standalone-shim",
    },
  },
});
```

## Usage

```vue
<!-- Root.vue -->
<script setup lang="ts">
import { AuiProvider, AuiConfig } from "@assistant-ui/vue";
import Composer from "./Composer.vue";
import { ComposerScope, ThreadScope } from "./scopes";

const config = AuiConfig({
  thread: ThreadScope(),
  composer: ComposerScope(),
});
</script>

<template>
  <AuiProvider :config="config"><Composer /></AuiProvider>
</template>
```

```vue
<!-- Composer.vue -->
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useAui, useAuiState } from "@assistant-ui/vue";

const aui = useAui();
const isRunning = useAuiState((s) => s.thread.isRunning);
</script>

<template>
  <button :disabled="isRunning" @click="aui.composer.send()">Send</button>
</template>
```

`useAui` returns a stable client whose scope accessors always resolve to the provider's current client. `useAuiState` returns a computed ref that updates when the selected slice changes by `Object.is`. `useAuiEvent` subscribes to assistant events for the lifetime of the current effect scope.

## Primitives

Headless components for runtime-backed threads, mirroring the React primitives. Mount a runtime with `RuntimeAdapter` from `@assistant-ui/core/store` and compose:

- `ThreadPrimitiveMessages` renders its default slot once per thread message, each instance scoped through `MessageByIndexProvider` (descendants read `s.message` and the message's edit composer as `s.composer`).
- `ComposerPrimitiveInput` is a textarea bound to the composer text; Enter submits, Shift+Enter inserts a newline, IME composition is ignored.
- `ComposerPrimitiveSend` and `ComposerPrimitiveCancel` are buttons wired to the composer with the same disabled semantics as the React primitives.
- `ThreadPrimitiveViewport` is a scroll container that keeps the thread pinned to the bottom while the user is at the bottom, scrolls down on run start, and unpins when the user scrolls up. It provides the scroll channel `ThreadPrimitiveScrollToBottom` drives: a button, placed inside the viewport, that jumps back down and disables while already at the bottom.
- `MessagePrimitiveParts` renders the current message's content parts, each scoped through `PartByIndexProvider`; a slot named after the part type overrides its rendering, and text parts render their text by default.
- `BranchPickerPrimitivePrevious`/`Next`/`Number`/`Count` navigate and display message branches.
- `ActionBarPrimitiveEdit`, `ActionBarPrimitiveReload`, and `ActionBarPrimitiveCopy` cover the widget-free message actions; inside a message scope the composer primitives double as the edit UI (`beginEdit` seeds the edit composer, `ComposerPrimitiveSend` saves into a new branch, `ComposerPrimitiveCancel` discards).
- `ThreadPrimitiveSuggestions` renders the default slot once per configured suggestion (`Suggestions([...])` from `@assistant-ui/core/store` in the provider config), scoped through `SuggestionByIndexProvider`; `SuggestionPrimitiveTrigger` sends the prompt (`send`) or inserts it into the composer, and `SuggestionPrimitiveTitle`/`Description` render its text.
- `ThreadListPrimitiveItems` renders the default slot once per thread (scoped through `ThreadListItemByIndexProvider`), with `ThreadListPrimitiveNew`, `ThreadListItemPrimitiveTrigger`, and `ThreadListItemPrimitiveTitle` (default slot or `fallback` string when the title is empty) covering the sidebar basics; the runtime supplies the list through the external-store `adapters.threadList`.
- `AuiIf` renders its slot while a state selector returns true.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import {
  ComposerPrimitiveInput,
  ComposerPrimitiveSend,
  ThreadPrimitiveMessages,
} from "@assistant-ui/vue";
import ChatMessage from "./ChatMessage.vue";
</script>

<template>
  <ol>
    <ThreadPrimitiveMessages>
      <ChatMessage />
    </ThreadPrimitiveMessages>
  </ol>
  <ComposerPrimitiveInput placeholder="Say something" />
  <ComposerPrimitiveSend>Send</ComposerPrimitiveSend>
</template>
```
