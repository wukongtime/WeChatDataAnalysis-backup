# WeChat MCP Copilot

Use WeChatDataAnalysis MCP like an investigator: start broad, resolve fuzzy targets, then fetch only the context needed to answer.

## Core Rules

1. Start with `references/routing.md`.
2. Load only one domain reference after routing.
3. Load `references/pagination-budget.md` before broad searches, exports, or multi-page scans.
4. Use `references/failure-recovery.md` when MCP, database readiness, or empty results are unclear.
5. For phone, ScreenMemo, or external MCP clients, prefer `wechat.mobile.*` facade tools before low-level tools.
6. Do not load the full tool catalog unless the user asks about available tools.
